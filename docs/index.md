# FoundationOne Docs

This repository hosts a GitHub Pages documentation site for my projects.

## Projects

- **CUDA TCP/IP** — a C++20 + CUDA (sm_50) + epoll TCP server that runs a tiny GPU transform per message.  
  Source code: https://github.com/waqasm86/cuda-tcp-ip

## Why this repo exists

I keep each project’s code in its own repository, but host a clean, searchable documentation portal here.
